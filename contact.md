I'm always looking to meet and work with interesting people. If you have a project that you think I'd be good for, or if you just want to say hello, shoot me an email at [jordan.barhorst@gmail.com](mailto:jordan.barhorst@gmail.com), or give me a call at 513-212-1578. I can usually be bought for a couple glasses of Mad Tree or Rhinegeist beer, a breakfast buffet, or Reds tickets.
