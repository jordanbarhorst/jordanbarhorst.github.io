My name is Jordan, and I like to design things. I make things for the web look really, really good, and work even better. I've also been known to dabble in photography, videography, and graphic design. 

I am currently a Front-end Web Designer and Developer at [Openfield Creative] (http://www.openfieldcreative.com), where we make awesome things. My freelance work has been recognized in the community, and recently I was named one of the [Top 20 Web Designers in Cincinnati] (https://www.expertise.com/oh/cincinnati/web-design#provider5) by expertise.com. Check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordanbarhorst) to see what else I've done in my professional career, and check out [Dribbble](http://www.dribbble.com/jordanbarhorst) to see some of my extracaricular design fun things. I also am constantly trying to be funny on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/JordanBarhorst).

When I'm not designing things I'm hanging out with my wife, Chelsey, my dog, Evie, and my cat, Kingsley. On weekends, my wife and I are a super-duo husband and wife photography team. Check out our work over at [chelseybarhorstphotography.com] (http://www.chelseybarhorstphotography.com)! I used to be a sports journalist, and still like to write about my Cincinnati Reds from time to time. Nowadays my writing mostly focuses on Web Design, and will eventually be housed right here at my blog, when I've got it up and running.

I'm always looking to meet and work with interesting people. If you have a project that you think I'd be good for, or if you just want to say hello, shoot me an email at [jordan.barhorst@gmail.com](mailto:jordan.barhorst@gmail.com). I can usually be bought for a couple pints of local craft beer, a breakfast buffet, or Reds tickets.
